# scenario-builder
Character backstory and scenario builder for PROCJAM 2017.

The goal is to generate character bios formulated as [Richard Evan's exclusion logic statements](). Then, hopefully turn them into some interesting prose and/or feed these statements into another generator...

Built off of:
- @sequitur's [Improv](https://github.com/sequitur/improv).
- Babel.
