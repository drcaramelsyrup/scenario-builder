# scenario-builder
Character backstory and scenario builder for PROCJAM 2017.

The goal is to generate character bios formulated a la Richard Evan's [exclusion logic statements](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-14183-6_14). Then, hopefully turn them into some interesting prose and/or feed these statements into another generator...

Built off of:
- Babel.
- Mocha.

Inspiration from 
- [Versu](https://versu.com) (Richard Evans, Emily Short).
- @sequitur's [Improv](https://github.com/sequitur/improv).

`npm install` to install dependencies,
`npm test` to run unit tests,
`npm start` to (eventually) generate events
