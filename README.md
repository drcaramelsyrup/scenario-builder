# scenario-builder
Character backstory and scenario builder for PROCJAM 2017.

The goal is to generate character bios formulated a la Richard Evan's [exclusion logic statements](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-14183-6_14). Then, hopefully turn them into some interesting prose and/or feed these statements into another generator...

Built off of:
- @sequitur's [Improv](https://github.com/sequitur/improv).
- Babel.
- Mocha.
